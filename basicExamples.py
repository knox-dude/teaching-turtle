# First, create a Turtle object using this command:
bob = turtle.Turtle()
# We have now created a Turtle object called bob.

# This is a list of commands that you can use with bob:

for number amount of pixels
"""
bob.forward(100)

"""
position() -> tells you what position your turtle is at
"""

turtle.done()
